# Discord-Rules-Bot

# Setup
In order to set up this Discord bot, you must first create a file named "token.json" and insert yor bot token into it in a structure similar to the following:

```
{
    "token": "<your token here>"
}
```

Next, you'll want to modify "botconfig.json" to properly reflect the configuration for your server including the command that will be used to accept and the role that will be applied once accepted.

Finally, you'll want to set up and run the bot utilizing the following commands:

```
npm install
node index.js
```

And if all went well, the bot should be up and running!
